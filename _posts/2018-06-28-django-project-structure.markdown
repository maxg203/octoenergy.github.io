[James Beith](https://twitter.com/jamesbeith?lang=en), a member of our tech team, has written up an excellent post on [how
to structure a Django
project](https://www.jamesbeith.co.uk/blog/how-to-structure-django-projects/), based on how we structure our Django projects
here at Octopus Energy.

We've found that Django's emphasis on re-usable apps can lead to structural
problems and a three-layer approach, where data and application logic are
clearly separated works better for large Django projects.

There's some discussion of this approach over on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17408958).
