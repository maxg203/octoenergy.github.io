excerpt: Wanted - Empathetic software engineers
---

**Employment Type**: Full-time, permanent

**Location**: Soho, London

**Remote**: Not at the moment

We are a tech-focussed energy supplier for the UK market and we're looking for
diligent software engineers (especially with Python experience) to join us.

We're using open-source software to build a modern, event-driven infrastructure
for interacting with both consumers (via the web, mobile and smart-meters) and
the industry (eg data flows, consumption forecasting, trading on the wholesale
market).

On the server-side, our main language is Python. Our [public site](https://octopus.energy) and internal services employ Django and the Django-REST-framework - we
also use Pandas, Numpy and Jupyter extensively for analysis and forecasting.

We use AWS heavily, employing most of the "Hashistack" (eg Packer, Consul,
Terraform, Atlas) as part of a continuous deployment pipeline. See, for example,
our article on [effective ELB healthchecks](http://tech.octopus.energy/2016/05/05/django-elb-health-checks.html).

Client-side, we use React and SASS; our mobile apps are built using React
Native.

Engineering standards are high. All code is well tested and thoroughly reviewed.

This is a great opportunity for several reasons:

* We have lots of difficult *design* challenges to solve. The UK energy market
  is complicated, dated and process-heavy - there's an awful lot of domain
  modelling that we need to get right.

* We have difficult *technical* problems to solve. With the advent of smart
  meters, we'll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need
  the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding
  data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption.

* There's a great opportunity for disruption in the UK energy market. The
  big suppliers still dominate, but are not exactly popular. The energy
  landscape is changing as we move to more disaggregated forms of
  generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter
  technology.

* You'll be working for a company that is helping to tackle climate
  change. We'll be helping move people onto using greener technology and
  consuming energy from renewable sources. This will all help transition
  the UK towards a lower carbon future.
